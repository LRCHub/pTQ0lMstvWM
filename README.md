[00:07.72] Tell me why I think so much about it
[00:11.12] But don't even matter at all
[00:13.77] Tell me why you come right back around
[00:17.07] But can't even answer my calls
[00:18.45] Am I just a safe bet?
[00:22.55] Is it safe to say I'm wasting all my time?
[00:24.34] I love you and I hate it
[00:27.98] I need somethin' just to get you out my mind
[00:28.49] 
[00:30.88] Fell in love with the girl next door
[00:33.76] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[00:36.34] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[00:39.59] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[00:42.52] Fell in love with the girl next door
[00:45.09] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[00:48.02] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[00:51.31] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[00:52.34] 
[00:55.16] I used to think that you were perfect, now I know the truth is
[00:58.18] That you're just like the other girls, why do I always do this?
[01:01.09] 'Cause I gave you my heart, and now I'm watching you abuse it
[01:03.75] But I don't learn no matter how many times
[01:05.93] You keep making me dizzy, messin' with my head
[01:08.87] I'm still reminiscing on words that you said
[01:11.80] T-t-tell me you miss me, then leave me on read
[01:14.86] You lean in to kiss me, then leave me for dead
[01:15.60] 
[01:17.47] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:20.09] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:23.18] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[01:26.47] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[01:29.06] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:31.78] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:34.74] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[01:38.17] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[01:38.92] 
[01:42.20] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:49.40] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:49.80] 
[01:52.34] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:55.20] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:58.09] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[02:01.31] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[02:03.99] Fell in love with the girl next door
[02:06.72] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[02:09.45] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
