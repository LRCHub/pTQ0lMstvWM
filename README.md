[00:07.88] Tell me why I think so much about it
[00:11.10] But don't even matter at all
[00:13.63] Tell me why you come right back around
[00:16.96] But can't even answer my calls
[00:18.50] Am I just a safe bet?
[00:22.52] Is it safe to say I'm wasting all my time?
[00:24.35] I love you and I hate it
[00:28.24] I need somethin' just to get you out my mind
[00:28.80] 
[00:30.95] Fell in love with the girl next door
[00:33.71] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[00:36.40] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[00:39.30] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[00:42.46] Fell in love with the girl next door
[00:45.20] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[00:48.15] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[00:52.42] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[00:52.95] 
[00:55.13] I used to think that you were perfect, now I know the truth is
[00:58.14] That you're just like the other girls, why do I always do this?
[01:01.11] 'Cause I gave you my heart, and now I'm watching you abuse it
[01:03.01] But I don't learn no matter how many times
[01:05.95] You keep making me dizzy, messin' with my head
[01:08.78] I'm still reminiscing on words that you said
[01:11.74] T-t-tell me you miss me, then leave me on read
[01:14.59] You lean in to kiss me, then leave me for dead
[01:15.12] 
[01:17.45] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:20.13] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:22.84] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[01:25.94] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[01:28.74] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:31.65] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:34.45] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[01:37.84] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[01:38.59] 
[01:43.60] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:49.44] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:49.96] 
[01:52.15] Fell in love with the girl next door
[01:55.02] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[01:58.04] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[02:00.94] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
[02:03.76] Fell in love with the girl next door
[02:06.61] Fell so hard, I almost went through the floor
[02:09.63] Gave you my heart, and now you tell me you're bored
[02:12.37] You do this all the time, I know it, I'm sure
